## 🔹 Website Description (Short – 300–500 chars)

TripSaver is a travel discovery and decision-support platform that helps users identify suitable destinations and booking platforms based on season, budget, and travel preferences.

We do not offer direct bookings. Users are redirected to trusted partners such as Agoda and Booking.com after viewing transparent, reason-based recommendations. Our focus is on informed travel planning, not price guarantees or forced redirection.

---

## 🔹 How Traffic Is Generated

Traffic is generated organically through SEO-focused destination content, seasonal travel guides, and intent-based search tools. Users actively search for destinations, travel months, and trip suitability before choosing a booking partner.

---

## 🔹 How Users Are Redirected (Very Important)

Users first receive destination insights and suitability explanations on our platform. Booking links are displayed only after user interaction, allowing them to choose the preferred partner platform. No automatic redirects, pop-ups, or misleading pricing claims are used.

---

## 🔹 Compliance & Transparency Statement

TripSaver follows affiliate program policies strictly. We clearly disclose affiliate relationships and do not modify, mask, or frame partner content. All redirections use approved deep links provided by the partner or affiliate network.

---

## 🔹 Monetization Disclosure (Footer / Page)

TripSaver may earn a commission when users book through partner links. This does not influence how destinations or platforms are recommended.

---

## 🔹 Why Agoda / Booking.com Is a Fit

Agoda and Booking.com are presented as booking options where relevant, based on destination coverage, seasonal availability, and user needs such as flexibility or accommodation type. We position partners as trusted booking platforms rather than exclusive or guaranteed options.
